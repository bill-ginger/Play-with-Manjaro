# Play-with-Manjaro

### Introduction
Manjaro was called the best distribution of linux. 

It is based on arch, and also known for its good support for hardwares(MHWD: Manjaro HardWare Detection).

You can see more about Manjaro at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjaro) and [official website](https://manjaro.org/)

The desktop environment I use is KDE, because I think it's beautiful and I want to learn about it. I have been quite familiar with gnome by using Ubuntu.

I once installed Manjaro KDE on a physical machine, wanting to use it as a daily productive system, but I encountered problems concerning wine, so I dropped.

Now in this repo, I will play with Manjaro in a virtual machine.

With regard to virtual machine, I firstly installed it in VMware, as it's usually more convenient than VirtualBox.
