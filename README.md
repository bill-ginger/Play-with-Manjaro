# Play-with-Manjaro
Manjaro was called the best distribution of linux. 

It is based on arch, and also known for its good support for hardwares(MHWD: Manjaro HardWare Detection).

I once installed it on a physical machine, wanting to use it as a daily productive system, but I encountered problems concerning wine, so I dropped.

This whole repo is based on Virtual Machine, the desktop environment is KDE, I think it's beautiful and I want to learn about it. I have been quite familiar with gnome by using Ubuntu.
